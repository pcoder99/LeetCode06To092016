Problem Statement
  Given a 2D grid, each cell is either Enemy ("e"), or Wall ("w"), or empty ("0"), given a BOMB, find the most enemy it can kill.
  A bomb can kill all the enemy in the same column and row until it hits the wall because the wall is too strong to destroy. 
  Please not the bomb can only be putted on an empty cell.
