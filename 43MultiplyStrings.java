PS:
  Given two integers represented as strings, return multiplication of the integers as a string.
  
  assuming: all are non-negative, the number can be arbitray large
  how to find the position of the result is the key of the problem
  
  num1[i] * num2[j] will be persiste in i + j, i + j + 1. Actually, i + j is higher position and i + j + 1 is lower postion
